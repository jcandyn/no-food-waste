                            <p class="card-text">Composting is a natural process that turns
                                organic waste into nutrient-rich soil, reducing landfill waste
                                and greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Compost improves soil health by adding
                                essential nutrients, improving soil structure, and encouraging
                                beneficial microbial activity.</p>

                            <h3>Understanding Food Composting</h3>
                            <p>Composting food waste is a sustainable way to reduce kitchen waste and enrich your garden
                                soil. It involves the biological decomposition of organic material under controlled
                                conditions to create a nutrient-rich compost.</p>

                            <h3>Setting Up Your Compost Bin</h3>
                            <p>Choose a compost bin or pile in a dry, shady spot near a water source. You can use a
                                tumbler, a stationary bin, or simply designate a small area in your garden for
                                composting. For apartments or small spaces, a countertop or under-sink compost bin works
                                well.</p>

                            <h3>What You Can Compost</h3>
                            <p>Start with vegetable and fruit scraps, eggshells, coffee grounds, and tea bags. These
                                items break down quickly and add valuable nutrients to the compost.</p>

                            <h3>Composting Process</h3>
                            <p>Alternate layers of 'greens' (food scraps) with 'browns' (dry leaves, shredded paper) in
                                your bin. This balance helps maintain the necessary moisture and aeration for efficient
                                decomposition.</p>

                            <h3>Maintaining Your Compost</h3>
                            <p>Regularly mix or turn the compost to oxygenate it and speed up the decomposition process.
                                Keep the compost moist, but not too wet, and cover the bin to maintain moisture and
                                warmth, which are essential for composting.</p>

                            <h3>Using Your Compost</h3>
                            <p>Once your compost turns into a dark, crumbly material with an earthy odor, it’s ready to
                                use. You can add it to your garden beds or use it as potting soil to enrich your plants.

                            <h3>Compostable Food Scraps</h3>
                            <p>Many kitchen scraps are excellent for composting, turning waste into valuable nutrients
                                for your garden soil. Here’s what you can include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Fruit Scraps</strong>: Apple cores, banana peels, citrus rinds (in
                                    moderation), and other fruit remains.</li>
                                <li><strong>Vegetable Scraps</strong>: Carrot peels, lettuce, other vegetable leftovers,
                                    and peels.</li>
                                <li><strong>Eggshells</strong>: Crushed eggshells add calcium to the compost, but avoid
                                    adding eggs themselves.</li>
                                <li><strong>Coffee Grounds and Tea Leaves</strong>: Used coffee grounds and tea leaves,
                                    including paper filters and tea bags (if plastic-free).</li>
                                <li><strong>Grains</strong>: Stale bread, cooked rice, pasta, and other grains.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Foods to Avoid in Compost</h3>
                            <p>While many food scraps benefit your compost, some should be avoided as they can attract
                                pests, create bad odors, or introduce pathogens:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Meat and Fish Scraps</strong>: These can attract rodents and cause
                                    unpleasant odors.</li>
                                <li><strong>Dairy Products</strong>: Cheese, butter, yogurt, and milk products are also
                                    likely to attract pests.</li>
                                <li><strong>Fats and Oils</strong>: These materials can disrupt the composting process
                                    and attract pests.</li>
                                <li><strong>Processed Foods</strong>: Avoid composting heavily processed foods as they
                                    may contain preservatives and other chemicals.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Best Practices for Composting Food Waste</h3>
                            <p>To maintain a healthy compost, balance your food scraps with 'browns' like dry leaves,
                                straw, or shredded paper. This helps to create the right environment for composting and
                                prevents issues like odor and pests.</p>

                            <h3>Optimal Preparation of Food Waste</h3>
                            <p>Proper preparation of food waste can significantly enhance the efficiency of the
                                composting process. Here are some tips to prepare your kitchen scraps:</p>

                            <h3>Size Matters</h3>
                            <p>Chop or break down larger food scraps into smaller pieces. Smaller pieces provide more
                                surface area for microorganisms to work on, speeding up the composting process.</p>

                            <h3>Managing Moisture</h3>
                            <p>Food scraps, especially fruits and vegetables, can be high in moisture. Balance this by
                                adding dry materials like leaves, straw, or shredded paper to absorb excess moisture and
                                maintain aeration.</p>

                            <h3>Avoiding Odors</h3>
                            <p>To prevent odors, bury food scraps under a layer of browns or garden soil in your compost
                                bin. This helps in quicker decomposition and minimizes smell.</p>

                            <h3>Composting Citrus and Onions</h3>
                            <p>While citrus peels and onions are compostable, they should be added in moderation. These
                                materials can be acidic and potentially harmful to worms in worm composting systems.</p>

                            <h3>Eggshells</h3>
                            <p>Crush eggshells before adding them to your compost. They are a great source of calcium
                                but take a long time to decompose if left in larger pieces.</p>

                            <h3>Coffee Grounds and Tea Leaves</h3>
                            <p>Used coffee grounds and tea leaves can be added directly to your compost. Ensure to
                                remove any plastic from tea bags, as plastic does not decompose.</p>

                            <h3>Keeping Pests Away from Your Compost</h3>
                            <p>One of the challenges of composting, especially food waste, is avoiding pests. Here are
                                some effective strategies:</p>

                            <h3>Use a Closed Bin</h3>
                            <p>A closed compost bin with a lid or cover can significantly reduce the likelihood of pests
                                being attracted to your compost. Ensure the bin has proper aeration to facilitate the
                                composting process.</p>

                            <h3>Avoid Composting Meat and Dairy</h3>
                            <p>Meat, fish, dairy products, and fats can attract rodents and insects. These items also
                                tend to produce unpleasant odors as they decompose, so it's best to keep them out of
                                your compost pile.</p>

                            <h3>Balance Your Compost</h3>
                            <p>Keep a good balance of green (nitrogen-rich) and brown (carbon-rich) materials in your
                                compost. Too many greens can lead to odors that attract pests. Browns help to absorb
                                excess moisture and reduce smells.</p>

                            <h3>Bury Food Scraps</h3>
                            <p>When adding food scraps to your compost, bury them under a layer of browns or existing
                                compost. This helps to minimize odors and makes the scraps less accessible to pests.</p>

                            <h3>Maintain Regular Composting Practices</h3>
                            <p>Regularly turn or mix your compost to accelerate decomposition and reduce the likelihood
                                of pest infestations. A well-maintained compost pile is less attractive to pests.</p>

                            <h3>Monitor and Adjust</h3>
                            <p>Regularly check your compost pile for signs of pests. If you notice an increase in pest
                                activity, adjust your composting practices, and consider adding more browns or using a
                                more secure compost bin.</p>
